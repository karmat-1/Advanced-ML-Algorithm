# Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository covers my **7-day learning roadmap** on advanced machine learning algorithms, focusing on ensemble methods and modern boosting techniques.  
Each day introduces key concepts with practical implementations, leading up to a final project that compares different ensemble models on a real dataset.
